Q1)Flat File Systems vs. Relational Databases:

1. Structure

-Flat File Systems store data in plain files such as text files, CSV, or spreadsheets. All information is usually kept in a single file or a few separate files, and there is no strict structure.

-Relational Databases store data in multiple tables with rows and columns. These tables have defined structures (schemas) and can be linked together.

2. Data Redundancy

-Flat File Systems often contain repeated information because they do not have a way to connect separate files. The same data may appear in many places.

-Relational Databases minimize redundancy by organizing data into related tables. Common information is stored once and referenced when needed.

3. Relationships

-Flat File Systems do not support relationships between files. If you need relationships, you must manually manage them.

-Relational Databases support relationships using primary and foreign keys. This allows tables to connect logically (e.g., Customer ↔ Orders).

4. Example Usage

-Flat File Systems are used for simple tasks such as logs, configuration files, small lists, or storing simple data like contact lists in a text file.

-Relational Databases are used in complex systems like banking, hotel management, hospital systems, e-commerce, and any application that needs organized, linked, and searchable data.

5. Drawbacks

-Flat File Systems:

.Hard to maintain when data grows large

.High data duplication

.No support for complex queries

.Difficult to ensure data accuracy

-Relational Databases

.Require more setup and expertise

.Need database software (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL)

.More resource-heavy compared to simple files

Q3)Roles in a Database System:
1. System Analyst

-Understands the needs of the business or users.

-Decides what the system should do.

-Creates requirements and helps design how the database should support the system.

2. Database Designer

-Plans the structure of the database.

-Designs tables, relationships, keys, and rules.

-Ensures the database is efficient, organized, and follows standards.

3. Database Developer

-Builds the actual database based on the design.

-Writes SQL queries, stored procedures, triggers, and views.

-Helps implement features like data validation and automation inside the database.

4. DBA (Database Administrator)

-Manages and maintains the database daily.

-Responsible for backup, security, performance, and solving problems.

-Ensures the database runs smoothly without downtime.

5. Application Developer

-Builds the software or apps that use the database.

-Connects the front-end or back-end application to the database.

-Ensures data flows correctly between the user and the database.

6. BI (Business Intelligence) Developer

-Works with data for reporting and analysis.

-Creates dashboards, reports, and visualizations.
